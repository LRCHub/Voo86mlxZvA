That Arizona sky burning in your eyes
You look at me and, babe, I wanna catch on fire
It's buried in my soul like California gold
You found the light in me that I couldn't find

So when I'm all choked up, but I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down and the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

Lovers in the night, poets trying to write
We don't know how to rhyme, but, damn, we try
And all I really know, you're where I wanna go
The part of me that's you will never die

So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down and the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

Oh yeah, I don't wanna be just a memory, baby, yeah
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo

So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
So when the sun goes down and the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way, way, yeah
When you look at me and the whole world fades
I'll always remember us this way, hmm, ooh
