[00:00.33] That Arizona sky
[00:04.82] Burning in your eyes
[00:08.87] You look at me and babe, I wanna catch on fire
[00:15.59] It's buried in my soul
[00:19.39] Like California gold
[00:23.59] You found the light in me that I couldn't find
[00:46.59] 
[00:30.62] So when I'm all choked up, but I can't find the words
[00:38.43] Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
[00:45.98] When the sun goes down
[00:49.45] And the band won't play
[00:53.34] I'll always remember us this way
[01:09.34] 
[00:59.90] Lovers in the night
[01:03.89] Poets trying to write
[01:07.72] We don't know how to rhyme, but damn we try
[01:14.39] But all I really know
[01:18.15] You're where I wanna go
[01:22.62] The part of me that's you will never die
[01:42.62] 
[01:29.81] So when I'm all choked up, but I can't find the words
[01:37.62] Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
[01:44.99] When the sun goes down
[01:48.67] And the band won't play
[01:52.35] I'll always remember us this way
[02:08.35] 
[01:57.44] Oh, yeah
[01:59.71] I don't wanna be just a memory, baby, yeah
[02:04.15] Hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo, hoo, hoo
[02:07.60] Hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo, hoo, hoo
[02:11.38] Hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
[02:26.88] 
[02:17.56] So when I'm all choked up, but I can't find the words
[02:25.18] Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
[02:32.64] When the sun goes down
[02:36.38] And the band won't play
[02:39.73] I'll always remember us this way, way, yeah
[03:01.23] 
[02:47.35] When you look at me
[02:50.96] And the whole world fades
[02:54.81] I'll always remember us this way
[03:10.81] 
[03:08.05] Ooh-ooh, hmm
[03:11.05] Oh, no, hm-hm
